# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a GitHub Pages website for Infinite Looper Studios. The repository is currently in early development with minimal structure - just a README and brand assets (logos/headers).

## Repository Structure

- `assets/` - Brand assets including logos, headers, and example images
- `README.md` - Basic project description

## Development Notes

This appears to be intended as a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. Since there are no HTML files yet, the main development tasks will likely involve creating the initial website structure and pages.

No build tools, package managers, or testing frameworks are currently configured.
